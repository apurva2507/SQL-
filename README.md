My project showcases SQL scripts and queries designed for efficient database management and insightful data analysis. Key features include:

Database Creation: Structured tables with appropriate data types, primary keys, and relationships for a well-organized database schema.

Data Insertion and Updates: Scripts for inserting, updating, and deleting data, ensuring dynamic and controlled modifications.

Query Optimization: Efficient SQL queries using techniques such as indexing, joins, and subqueries to improve performance.

Data Analysis: Complex queries for extracting meaningful insights, such as aggregations, filtering, and sorting.

Stored Procedures and Triggers: Examples of automation and workflows for repetitive tasks and data validation.

Use Cases: Application of SQL code for solving real-world problems like sales trends, inventory management, or customer segmentation.

This repository demonstrates my ability to write clean, modular, and well-documented SQL code for practical applications in database management and analytics.
